ctreeExport
===========

This repository contains R-code to export a ctree to a textfile and C# code to import the text file and use the tree-structure in C# projects.

Ctrees are Conditional Inference Trees as described in the R package partykit (see http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/partykit/partykit.pdf).
